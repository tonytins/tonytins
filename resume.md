**Freelancer** (2017-Present)

- Developed and maintain CST.NET and CST.rs, reimplementation of the parser for ``.cst`` files originally used in The Sims Online and now also used internally within my projects.
- Developed TOMAS, a managed operating system based on COSMOS framework.

## Projects

### CST.NET

A reimplementation of the parser for ``.cst`` files originally used in The Sims Online. The project has its roots with another project I was a part of, which aimed to reverse engineer The Sims Online, but CST.NET is competently independent. The code bears little resemblance to what that inspired it, apart from acting as a drop-in replacement. However, it is used internally within my own projects after I published it to Nuget. Developed using C#, but also has a Rust variant.

### TOMAS

A managed operating system based on COSMOS framework, developed using C#.

### Commission Manager

A desktop application for tracking commissions, adoptable characters, and YCH (Your Character Here) transactions with the information that can be exported to other databases or modified externally from a spreadsheet program in the CST format. Developed using C# and utilizing MAUI and Blazor frameworks.

### Ryubook

A command line application written in C# that generates epub files from Markdown using Pandoc as the backend for generation.

### Blue Rose

Developed as a simple launcher and updater for a project that reverse engineered The Sims Online, it was written using C# with Windows Forms. It served to replace the original old launcher after the reverse engineering project switched leads and development rapidly speed up.

It was a learning experience in using Blazor and working with modern web app frameworks like Bootstrap. Unfortunately, my lack of familiarity with Blazor at the time, and modern web app frameworks, led to some complexity that made it hard to maintain.

## Past Projects

### Blazor Art Gallery

I developed a personal art gallery, inspired by DeviantART, using C# and Blazor. The project had no official name or code name, but it was simply referred to as "WebApp" and was my first time working with Blazor. The goal of the project was to create a web application where I can upload, view, and manage my artworks, but anyone could view it. Being an artist before a programmer, it was my own way to showcase my artworks and improve my skill on webdev.


## Appreciation

I would like to take a moment to acknowledge my contributions to the Sims Online reverse engineering project that I was a part of. While my efforts may not have been officially recognized, I played a significant role in the development and progress of the project, such as the tools like Blue Rose.

One of my major contributions was the demonstration of how to switch the game from XNA to Monogame framework. At the time, the lead developer was hesitant to change to a new framework, but I was able to successfully pull it off. This greatly improved the game's performance and allowed for more efficient development going forward.

Unfortunately, I was not included in the actual porting process and my contribution with everything else remains uncredited. I hope you understand that is why I refuse to address the project by name. Nonetheless, I am proud of my contribution to the overall project and I believe it is important to acknowledge it. CST.NET alone should demonstrate how much I'm aware of the inner workings, especially considering how obscure format is.
