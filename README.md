# Arf! I'm Tony Bark. 🦊

I'm a self-taught indie developer focused on cross-platform games using Godot and desktop applications built with Tauri. I always aim for high maintainability with minimal technical debt. Earlier Tauri projects utilized Vue for the frontend, but starting with [Amtrak Status](https://github.com/tonytins/amtkstat), I've shifted to .NET Blazor. For all .NET-based programs, I target the latest LTS releases and strive to provide the bare minimum long-term support.

I design my libraries and applications—whether desktop or CLI—to be functional from day one. They're crafted for my own use, but you can use them too, even if it's just for a simple need or experimentation. 

Before committing an initial release, I rigorously test everything on my own systems. However, being a solo developer, I can't guarantee perfect compatibility across other platforms. I also follow a .NET-style versioning scheme, with version numbers starting in the 100s, either in the minor or patch section, for every type of software.

I'm not chasing perfection, just reliability. You can thank my very first public release, [Blue Rose](https://github.com/tonytins/BlueRoseClassic), for shaping that mindset.
