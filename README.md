# Arf! I'm Tony Bark. 🦊

I'm a self-taught indie developer focused on creating cross-platform games with Godot and desktop applications using Tauri. I prioritize high maintainability and aim to minimize technical debt. My earlier Tauri projects used a Vue frontend, but since [Amtrak Status](https://github.com/tonytins/amtkstat), I've transitioned to using .NET Blazor. Any .NET-based application I develop typically targets the latest LTS releases and ensures minimal long-term support when necessary.
