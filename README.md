# Arf! I'm Tony Bark. 🦊

I'm a self-taught indie developer. While I'm not chasing perfection, I do aim for reliability and I've learned to [code like NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code) over the years. My true passion is developing games, where I started with MonoGame before shifting towards RayLib and Godot.

When it comes to .NET, my go-to language, I stick with LTS (unless I need a newer API) and give my projects the same life cycle. You can thank a little accidental mishap with my first widely shared project, [Blue Rose](https://github.com/tonytins/BlueRoseClassic), for shaping that mindset.

Being a solo developer, I sometimes use AI to generate certain algorithms or just when I need a basic template to build off of, such as [StaggerPost](https://github.com/tonytins/StaggerPost). Nothing extreme.
