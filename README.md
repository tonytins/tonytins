# Arf! I'm Tony Bark. ðŸ¦Š

I'm a self-taught software developer with experience in C# and Rust. I'm an artist with a passion for programming and have been constantly teaching myself new skills. I strive for high maintainability and low technical debt in my projects.

I've developed CST.NET, a reimplementation of the parser for ``.cst`` files originally used in The Sims Online. Additionally, I have a Rust variant known as CST.rs, Commission Manager, a desktop application for tracking commissions and other transactions, utilizing MAUI and Blazor frameworks, and Ryubook, a epub generator that uses Pandoc as a backend.

See [here](resume.md) for more details on y projects.
